scd1 implementation:
Step1:
load the data which is upto date into TARGETTABLE_FINAL(new)
step2:
load the old table data into EVENT_DATA_ALL(old)
step3:
generate ID from TARGETTABLE_FINAL
EVENT_GEN = FOREACH TARGETTABLE_FINAL generate EVENT_SRC_ID;

step4:
Identify the duplicates by joining both 
JOINEDDATA = JOIN EVENT_DATA_ALL by event_src_id,EVENT_GEN by EVENT_SRC_ID; 
JOINEDDATA = foreach JOINEDDATA generate EVENT_DATA_ALL::event_src_id as event_src_id ;

step5:
Filter out the duplicates identified(if any) in the above step by using left outer joining and filter by null

DATA_FULL = JOIN TARGETTABLE_FINAL by EVENT_SRC_ID LEFT OUTER,  JOINEDDATA by event_src_id;
DATA_INSERT_ONLY = FILTER DATA_FULL BY JOINEDDATA::event_src_id IS null; 


Sample Example with dataset
Data set:
oldfile:
1,naresh,india
2,aparna,Coimbatore
3,Mahesh,Banglore
4,Chiiti,Karimnagar

new file:
1,naresh,Seattle
2,aparna,Hyderabad
4,Chiiti,Karimnagar

final file:
(1,naresh,Seattle,1)
(2,aparna,Hyderabad,2)
(4,Chiiti,Karimnagar,4)



--Load Target table data
new = load 'newfile' USING PigStorage(',') as (id,name,place);
old = LOAD 'oldfile' USING PigStorage(',') as (id,name,place);


new_id = FOREACH new generate id;

--Identify the duplicates by joining both
JOINEDDATA = JOIN old by id,new_id by id; 
JOINEDDATA = foreach JOINEDDATA generate old::id as id ;

Filter out the duplicates identified(if any) in the above step
DATA_FULL = JOIN new by id LEFT OUTER,  JOINEDDATA by id;
